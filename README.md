# XLChart
XLChart is very useful and easy for current data analyse, you can download it everywhere and any time for free, there is no worried  about how to use it because the entire project is a demo after downloaded you can run it directly.

Thanks to MJEXtension that i used to convert from json to model,it provide convenient method for me,XLChart that cost me several months to design and code,but it still has long way to go,I hope that someone would like to join me to accomplish the rest of it,if you found any bug ,please contact me with 329672851@qq.com of email.

At first bar chart and line chart had been divided because of it basic forms. through a series of improve quality of code and 
a better performance. i merged XLBarChart and XLLineChart into XLBarLineChart. so you guys can use XLBarLineChart class directly. however there are still little function of XLBarLineChart.
